I am an undergraduate at the University of Toronto Mississauga. My degree will be in computer science and mathematics, but I like learning about many different subjects. 
 
Last year I worked on a research study which looked into what undergraduate computer science students thought about mathematics, and in particular the mathematics in their computer science program. Now, I am working on a survey to investigate the same topic on a larger scale.
